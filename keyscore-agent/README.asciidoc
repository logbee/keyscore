[TIP]
====
If you need further information about running docker visit the official link:https://docs.docker.com/[Documentation] or take a look at our link:{rootDir}/docker.asciidoc[README].
====

To build a Docker image run:
```
gradle buildDockerImage
```

==== Single Node ====
To start a container use link:https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/[docker run]:
```
docker run --name keyscore-agent -d logbee/keyscore-agent:latest
```

==== Cluster ====
To connect an agent to a cluster it is import to configure the IP addresses:
```
docker run --name keyscore-agent --env KEYSCORE_REMOTE_HOST=172.17.0.3 --env KEYSCORE_REMOTE_BIND_HOST=172.17.0.3 --env KEYSCORE_CLUSTER_SEED_NODE_HOST=172.17.0.2 logbee/keyscore-agent
```
The environment variables `KEYSCORE_REMOTE_HOST` and `KEYSCORE_REMOTE_BIND_HOST` have to be configured to an interface which has access to a common network at which the other cluster nodes are reachable.
The environment variable `KEYSCORE_CLUSTER_SEED_NODE_HOST` has to point to another node of the cluster.
