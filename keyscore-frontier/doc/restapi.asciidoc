=== The keyscore-frontier REST API ===

The keyscore-frontier offers a REST API to control all aspects of keyscore.
Ths document is a brief summary of the most important parts of the API.
Due to the fact that the API is still work in progress this document will change.

[TIP]
====
For REST API testing, a browser extension is useful.
We recommend to use the following extensions:

* Chrome:   Restlet Client by Restlet
* Firefox:  RESTED by Espen H

==== Commons ====
Within keyscore all entities have an UUID.


==== Pipelines ====

The common url pattern to control pipelines starts with the prefix
`/pipeline`.
