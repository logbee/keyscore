= Building a pipeline =

*How to read this chapter*:

- If you are new -- nice to see you here, we are curious about your feedback -- you can simply read this
chapter from top to bottom starting with the <<Step-by-Step Guide>>.

- If you are already familiar with the UI and only need some general information about where to do what the <<UI-overview>>
will hopefully match your expectations.


== Step-by-Step Guide ==

This chapter will introduce the UI by providing a step-by-step guide which will conclude in a working pipeline you can
experiment with.
After you finished the guide you will be able to create pipelines and be familiar with the multiple concepts of configuration.

=== UI-Overview ===

Here you can find an overview over the multiple screens of the ui.
They provide a short description for the multiple actions.

=== Agents ===

- Agents Table - This Table enlists all the registered agents. By pushing the delete Button you can remove the agent form the list.
  This will not delete the running instance of the agent in the kubernetes cluster.

. Search - here you can search for every criteria which is listed in the data table.
. Delete - delete the agent from the table.

           Warning! This will not delete the running instance of the agent in the kubernetes cluster.

. Response - Responses to creating a pipeline are shown with this popup.

=== Pipeline-Editor ===
The Pipeline-Editor is the key-feature of the ui.

Generally there are three main components:

. Toolbar - In the Toolbar you can find a set of blocks which can be dragged into the workspace.
            They are ordered by categories.  If a block is in more than one category it will be present multiple times
            in the Toolbar.

. Configuration - Whether you are configuring the pipelines name, a sink source or filter, the possible configurations
                  are always displayed here.
//TODO: Add aditional image with datapreview
. Data Preview - When the Data Preview is active, it is displayed in the same location than the Toolbar.
                 It provides you with detailed information about what kind of data is running through your block.
