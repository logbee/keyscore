== Gradle and Docker
By default docker requires you to use the docker command as root and therefore you have to call gradle as root whenever the specified gradle task interacts with the docker daemon.

=== Manage Docker as a non-root user
If you donâ€™t want to use sudo when you use the docker command, create a Unix group called docker and add users to it.
Run the following commands in your favourite shell and then *completely log out of your account and log back in* (if in doubt, reboot).
```
sudo groupadd docker
sudo gpasswd -a $USER docker
newgrp docker
```
Now you can user docker as non-root user.
// end::gradledocker[]
